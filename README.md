# Linked Data VocabTerms Lookup Service
Vocabserver is a tool to make it easier to use existing vocabularies within your organization. 

The aim of this project is to provide a service that allows 
 - to add selected existing vocabularies and glossaries by reference (ingest & sync) 
 - allow adding translations to the vocabularies where necessary
 - Access the harvested content to terms via a fast lookup API solution (full-text search on labels and filters on categories)
 - the service is integratable in various applications via a [reusable lookup widgets](https://github.com/vlizBE/vocabserver-webcomponent)


## Code
This repository hosts the code and configurations for the backend of vocabsearch.

Related repositories are:

- [vocabserver-frontend](https://github.com/vlizBE/vocabserver-frontend/) hosting the code of the admin frontend
- [vocabserver-webcomponent](https://github.com/vlizBE/vocabserver-webcomponent) hosting the code of a webcomponent that can connect with this backend

A demo is currently available on https://vocabsearch.redpencil.io/ . 


## Setting up the backend

### Prerequisites
The backend was tested on ubuntu 20.04 and requires both docker and docker-compose to be installed.

This can be done with the following script:
```sh
# update system
apt update > /dev/null &&  apt upgrade -y

# docker
apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg |  apt-key add -
add-apt-repository \
     "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
apt update > /dev/null
apt -y install docker-ce
docker run --rm hello-world

# docker-compose
curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.28.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/compose/1.28.2/contrib/completion/bash/docker-compose -o /etc/bash_completion.d/docker-compose
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

# dr and drc auto completion
echo "complete -F _docker_compose drc" >> /etc/bash_completion.d/docker-compose
echo "complete -F _docker dr" >> /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/docker
```

### installation of the backend
```sh
  # clone the repository
  git clone https://github.com/vlizBE/vocabserver-app.git
  # start the backend
  cd vocabsearch-app
  docker-compose up
```

### configuration and reverse proxy
By default the backend will expose no ports on the docker host, if you want you can add a port mapping to the identifer to expose the backend service and admin interface. See the [docker-compose.dev.yml](https://github.com/vlizBE/vocabserver-app/blob/415a7d4ded4b391f6fc50a07b24230b9b9a19f70/docker-compose.dev.yml#L6) file for an example on how to do this.

For production use it's recommend to place the backend behind a reverse proxy, so only the search API is exposed publicly.
Assuming the following port mapping has been added to the identifier:
```yml
ports:
 - 127.0.0.1:8888:80
```

You could use the following nginx config to serve as a reverse proxy:

```
server {
    server_name my.vocabsearch.domain {
      location /concepts/search {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8888;  
      }
}
```
